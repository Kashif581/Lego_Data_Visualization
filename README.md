LEGO Data Analysis and Visualization, I have created this project that is related to The LEGO Group which is a Danish construction toy production company based in Billund, Denmark, Here we have data that I used to for visualization and analysis purposes. I used Pandas and Matplotlib for data cleaning and visualization, I plotted different charts that will help to reveal the insights
